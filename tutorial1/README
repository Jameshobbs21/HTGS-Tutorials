In the following tutorial we demonstrate the following:
(1) How to represent/create input/output data
(1a) How to prioritize the data
(2) How to operate on data with an ITask
(3) How to add an ITask to a TaskGraph
(4) How to add data to the graph
(5) How to process data from a graph


data/InputData.h - shows the input data
data/OutputData.h - shows the output data

tasks/SimpleAdd.h - Implements our add functionality: input type: InputData; output type: OutputData

API used:
htgs/api/IData
htgs/api/ITask
htgs/api/TaskGraph
htgs/api/Runtime

Lessons learned:

Functions to implement for defining a Task:
1) initialize - Called when a thread binds to a Task
2) shutdown - Called after isTerminated evaluates to true
3) executeTask - Execute function that processes data, and produces output data
4) copy - Creates a copy of the Task
5) isTerminated - Checks whether the Task is ready to be terminated or not.
